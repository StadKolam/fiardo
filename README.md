# Fiardo.com

This project is live on (https://www.fiardo.com).
Fiardo is a single page application developed by me.
On the homepage you will find a 3D drive-in movie screen where you can drive the blue car to a parking spot and view the trailer videos by driving through the letters or by simply clicking on them to jump to the subpage.
               
                    You have the following options:

              
                    Selecting letter R brings you to the record-page
                    Selecting letter A brings you to the about-page
                    Selecting letters F, I, D, O bring you to the coming-soon-page (currently under construction)
